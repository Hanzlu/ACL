# ACL
Advanced Computer Language (Esoteric)

A guide to the language https://esolangs.org/wiki/ACL

Python interpreter https://github.com/JonoCode9374/ACL-Python

The reason for the language is the lack of possibility to work close up with binary in modern languages, as well as the fun of creating your own languages.

It is anything but advanced. But that depends what you compare with.

The interpreter asks for an ACL source code file to interpret. You can respond with a filename (with extension) which is in the same directory as the interpreter or respond with a full path.

The memory is limited by the interpreter to the positive range of a Java int. That is also the highest number you can output as an integer. The existance of negative numbers have been ignored.

Keep positive :) 
Good luck.
